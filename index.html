                    the Marvel
                    Comics universe. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, the Green Goblin first appeared
                    in
                    While usually portrayed as a supervillain, Doctor Octopus has also been occasionally depicted as a
                    conflicted antihero and ally of Spider-Man. Following Spider-Man's death in the 2012 storyline
                    "Dying Wish", which saw a dying Octavius swapping bodies with the hero and letting him die in his
                    original body, Octavius was motivated to prove he could be a better Spider-Man. As such, he adopted
                    the Superior Spider-Man alias,
                    "The Amazing Spider-Man" #14 in 1964.

                    The Green Goblin's real identity is Norman Osborn, a wealthy and influential businessman who becomes
                    the
                    villain after a failed experiment with a serum that enhances his strength and intelligence but also
                    drives him insane. As the Green Goblin, Osborn wears a green costume and rides on a bat-shaped
                    glider.
                    He is known for his cunning intellect, technological prowess, and ruthless tactics.

                    The first big-screen animated adventure for Miles Morales in his journey as Spider-Man in
                    Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was a major success and won the Academy Award for Best Animated
                    Feature in 2019. Now, its sequel, Sony Pictures’ Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, has quickly
                    become a global phenomenon that is drawing rave reviews and big box office dollars. Into the
                    Spider-Verse introduced Miles (Shameik Moore), the film’s hero, having a crush on his new would-be
                    classmate and later fellow spider-hero, Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld), aka Spider-Woman. Across the
                    Spider-Verse takes their relationship a step further, but still falls short of pulling the trigger
                    on a full-blown romance between Miles and Gwen Stacy. That said, the third installment of
                    Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse might be headed in that direction.

                    appendages resembling an octopus's tentacles, which extend from the back of his body and can be used
                    for various purposes. After his mechanical harness became permanently fused to his body during a lab
                    accident, he turned to a life of crime, and came into conflict with the superhero Spider-Man. He has
                    endured as one of Spider-Man's most prominent villains, and is regarded as one of his three
                    archenemies, alongside the Green Goblin and Venom. He is the founder and leader of the Sinister Six,
